# Security Policy

SidecarSwitch runs as a local macOS background daemon that interacts with user sessions, LaunchAgents, Unix domain sockets, local subprocess execution, and system display controllers. We take local security and process isolation seriously.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

**A verified private reporting channel is not yet listed here.** Do not assume that a GitHub profile provides a private contact channel.

Until a private channel is published here, you may [open an issue](https://github.com/kcayut/SidecarSwitch/issues) solely to ask for a security contact. Do not include vulnerability descriptions, reproduction steps, exploit code, or sensitive logs in that public request. Keep the details private until a confidential channel is confirmed.

### What information to include:
- A clear description of the vulnerability.
- Steps to reproduce the issue (including any sample scripts or local state).
- The affected macOS version, architecture (Apple Silicon), and SidecarSwitch version.
- Potential impact or mitigation if known.

Response-time commitments will be published with the verified reporting channel.
