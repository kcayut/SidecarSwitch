## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-dev.5] - 2026-09-27

Development prerelease fixing physical-display handoff and iPad disconnection.

### Fixed
- Verify the physical display is active and main, then disconnect the configured virtual fallback before disconnecting iPad. Keep the virtual fallback when no physical display is available, and preserve the selected main display when several physical monitors are connected.
- Recognize both directions of mirroring and retain identifiable inactive physical displays during layout restoration. Use the original display identity when attempting recovery.
- Keep iPad connected if the fallback cannot be verified. If the physical display disappears after disconnection and recovery fails, attempt to reconnect the same iPad once, retain the error, and pause further automatic switching.
- Preserve cancellation when changing modes and report unsuccessful display recovery consistently in diagnostics.

### Documentation
- Clarify virtual-fallback lifetime, manual-mode behavior, display names reported by adapters, and safe disconnection in Traditional Chinese, English, and Japanese.

### Validation
- 295 automated tests passed, together with the installed app's handoff check. The user confirmed the fix on a Mac mini running macOS 26.6.2 with a Sony M9 connected through a USB-C-to-HDMI adapter.
- This confirms the reported handoff scenario only; other hardware, cold boot, sleep/wake, and the full supported-macOS matrix remain unverified for this release.

## [0.1.0-dev.3] - 2026-09-23

Development prerelease for Apple Silicon and macOS 14+, with a directly downloadable SidecarSwitch DMG and three-language installation guidance.

### Changed
- Correct website language URLs and add canonical URLs and a three-page sitemap.

### Fixed
- Package standard macOS icon sizes directly in the ICNS container when the system icon encoder cannot rebuild even its own decoded icons.
- Select only published releases containing a matching SidecarSwitch DMG; report when no prebuilt download is available.

## [0.1.0-dev.2] - 2026-09-20

Second public development prerelease. Includes the following changes since `v0.1.0-dev.1`.

### Added
- A three-language DMG installation layout with a BetterDisplay download shortcut, drag-to-Applications guidance, first-launch approval steps, and an offline installation guide.
- Per-display controls in Connected displays to include or exclude a monitor from physical-display detection, saved by display UUID, with a reset to automatic detection. Generic placeholders remain excluded by default; Sidecar and virtual fallback roles are unchanged.
- Contact email in the website's ECPay support section.

### Fixed
- Switching to Manual only can cancel a blocked connection round without waiting for hardware discovery or a connection command to return. Stop subsequent retries and main-display changes, discard older queued controls and UI callbacks, and keep explicit new connection requests usable. Commands already sent to macOS may still finish.
- Keep status and Manual only requests responsive during slow IPC operations; preserve connection-request coalescing and prevent cancelled boot work from restarting.
- Recover from release-update failure even when the replacement CLI cannot run, after independently confirming the replacement service and processes have stopped. Preserve the app and backup if shutdown cannot be verified.
- Align BetterDisplay requirements across the three languages: current SidecarSwitch features work without Pro or a trial; BetterDisplay's own license terms still apply.
- Make troubleshooting commands usable from a DMG installation without a source checkout or separate Python installation; distinguish source-only repair steps.
- Remove obsolete private-testing and repository-access wording, clarify how to request a security contact without publishing vulnerability details, and document the published development release below.

### Changed
- Remove the remaining development-document directory and stop tracking local agent instructions.

## [0.1.0-dev.1] - 2026-09-16

First public GitHub development prerelease, built from `27ce07453dbed94fb2c4063a482e3705974c26b9`. Published at `2026-09-16 16:16:53 UTC` (`2026-09-17 00:16:53` in Taiwan). This is a prerelease, not a stable `0.1.0` release.

### Added
- Relocatable **Apple Silicon / macOS 14+** app with bundled CPython and native Swift components. Published DMG, ZIP, `SHA256SUMS`, and `build-info.json`; users do not need a compiler, Homebrew, or a separate Python installation.
- Shared bundled/external Python selection for the app, CLI, and background service, with a bundled-runtime recovery command if an external Python is missing.
- A configurable global connection shortcut and bounded one-shot connection requests. Fresh installations use Manual only with optional headless boot connection enabled: search for up to three 30-second rounds, then make at most one bounded connection round. A later disconnect does not start another manual-mode connection round.
- Automatic USB event wakeup, configurable iPad inference, and explicit saved pairing selection. Saved Sidecar identities take priority; ambiguous or incomplete discovery does not guess a control target.
- Traditional Chinese, English, and Japanese native settings, diagnostics, pairing management, About content, and user guides; localized help links pinned to the source revision.
- Public three-language introduction website with GitHub Pages deployment, illustrated setup guidance, and a real-device demonstration video.
- Optional external support links for PayPal, Ko-fi, O'Pay, and ECPay in the relevant README, About, and website surfaces.
- Software, native-menu, layout, installer, security, and release-relocation checks, plus macOS Python 3.10/3.14 CI and an independent history privacy gate. Tag-triggered builds publish development release assets.

### Changed
- Replace the SwiftBar integration and Tk settings window with a native AppKit menu and SwiftUI settings, retaining the shared Python state engine and CLI/IPC actions.
- Reuse the existing settings window and preserve its page and drafts. Opening the app shows settings and the menu; login/background startup shows the menu only. Use distinct Manual only and stopped-service icons and the project artwork for the app icon.
- Use an app-bundled `SMAppService` login agent. Exit stops display automation; an enabled native login service watches for the app moving to Trash and unregisters itself. No external LaunchAgent plist is installed by this version.
- Provide source and release installers, explicit dependency-install choices, custom Python/BetterDisplay paths, and uninstall previews. Preserve existing preferences and app locations; retain settings, logs, and shared dependencies by default.
- Change the license from MIT to PolyForm Noncommercial 1.0.0 with attribution in `NOTICE`, bundled with the app. Rights to copies previously obtained under MIT remain unchanged.

### Fixed
- Pause automatic Sidecar retries after repeated failure instead of repeatedly reconnecting to an unavailable cached target. Retain the physical or virtual fallback, including after iPad takeover.
- Require both the configured Sidecar session and its online display before takeover. Preserve verified session/display identity through discovery loss and avoid changing displays when identity is unknown.
- Use configuration revisions to reject stale GUI changes and retain the original revision of unsaved drafts. Reject malformed configuration without silently enabling automation or overwriting it.
- Verify daemon ownership and startup handshakes, use shared primary/fallback state-file selection, and restore prior installation state on supported failure paths.
- Harden state, log, and socket permissions; reject foreign or linked state paths; omit IPC payloads from logs; and restrict stop/uninstall operations to verified owned targets.
- Handle dangling integration symlinks on Python 3.10, resolve custom BetterDisplay paths at startup, and check both installation shell scripts in release validation.

### Limitations
- BetterDisplay must be installed and running separately; its built-in CLI is sufficient.
- This release is ad-hoc signed, without Developer ID signing or Apple notarization, and has no Intel build.
- Software and relocation checks do not establish Sidecar, USB hotplug, sleep/wake, or cold-boot acceptance on every user's hardware. FileVault unlock and pre-login display takeover are not supported.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-10

Historical internal development record retained from the original changelog; this was not a tagged public stable release. The SwiftBar, Tk, and MIT descriptions below describe that earlier state.

### Added
- **Display State Machine**:
  - Automatic detection and negotiation between physical monitors, USB/Wireless Sidecar iPad, and BetterDisplay virtual screens.
  - User override preservation with hardware **Topology Generation Tracking**.
  - **Single-Flight Transition Lock** preventing race conditions during concurrent USB insertion and display wake events.
  - Physical display flicker debouncing (4.0s) and Sidecar connection cooldown protection (3 attempts with 30s cooldown).
- **macOS Menu Bar Integration**:
  - Dynamic SwiftBar plugin with status indicators (`🖥️`, `📱`, `◻️`, `⚠️`, `⏸️`).
  - Ultra-fast (< 5ms) atomic snapshot reading with zero-overhead background sync.
- **Card-Style GUI**:
  - Native Tkinter Card UI for pairing, multi-device management, diagnostics, and settings.
  - Comprehensive health checks (FileVault, automatic login, BetterDisplay permissions, LaunchAgent autostart).
- **CLI Management**:
  - Full-featured `sidecarswitch-cli` for service lifecycle, pairing wizards, mode switching, status query, and inspection.
- **Open Source Preparation**:
  - Standard MIT License.
  - Restructured documentation, troubleshooting guide, and installation guides.
  - GitHub issue forms and PR templates.
